# solar_panel_management_system

The objectives of this final year project:
1) To design an improved P&O algorithm, MPPT
2) To design a battery management system with forecasted load
   and weather prediction system by using machine learning.

The database obtained from the open source website was used for machine learning.

The initial design was to link the python machine learning and Simulink running simultaneously.
However due to the laptop spec limitation, the Simulink and ML were running seperately. 


Hardware requirement:
1) CPU higher than intel core i5-11th gen.
2) RAM bigger than 16GB.


To run it simultaneously or real time, the hardware should be powerful enough.
Suggestion:
1) CPU higher than intel core i9-12th gen.
2) RAM bigger than 32GB.
